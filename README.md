This project uses real Ecommerce data to perform NLP for Vietnamese language and machine learning tasks in order to settle a real-world business challenge of a company in Vietnam. We split our project into four tasks: NLP, sentiment analysis, recommendation system, and machine learning for sales predictive modeling.

<h2>Machine Learning for Sales Predictive Modeling</h2>
We used data of e-Commerce sales, customer, and product data to perform EDA and predictive modeling through feature engineering and selection, model development and evaluation of multiple supervised ML algorithms, unsupervised optimizations, hyperparameter tuning, and provided visualizations to avoid black box models. 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted after the data is processed through an extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline. The analysis revealed several area of weaknesses. As an example, one unexpected relationship is that there is little correlation between the ratings and factors such as shipping days. Further visualizations have been developed for the company, such as one showing that certain regions have more negative ratings, which indicates localized shipping issues to feed into on-the-ground investigations. 

Next, a ML model is built to allow the business to predict future behaviors of how products are likely to perform based on historical sales metrics. To develop accurate and reliable models, features are prepared, structured and selected that best describes the structure in the data. Additional features are engineered based on the E-commerce sales funnel.

Several models are developed using supervised learning algorithms. Random forest is used as a baseline, along with more sophisticated models including regression and XGBoost random forest, which is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library.

Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to enhance the models using Optuna. One hundred trials of the model are conducted on a search space for the optimal hyperparameters, allowing us to minimize the RMSE. 

The final model used is a XGBoost Random Forest model with R2 score of 0.95 and RMSE of 88.5m - an improvement of 75.0% over the baseline model. This indicates that the model has high accuracy of predicting future revenue from past sales data, enabling the company to be more responsive and confident in its revenue forecasting.
